# PhotosScreensaver


This project was created that was created both as an exercise in creating a windows C#/WPF screensaver and also to solve the problem with old photos screensaver that used a fixed random number seed.
This uses a seed based on time, which while not truly random will display a sufficiently differing set of pictures on each invocation.
